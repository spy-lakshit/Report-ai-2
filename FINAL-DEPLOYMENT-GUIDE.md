# 🚀 FINAL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - FIXED VERSION

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The **404 NOT_FOUND** error was caused by:
1. **Incorrect vercel.json configuration** - was trying to redirect to a non-existent path
2. **Complex API file** - the previous API was too complex and might have caused issues
3. **Missing index.html** - the main HTML file wasn't in the root directory

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

1. **Simplified vercel.json** - Removed problematic redirects
2. **Created simple, working API** - Clean, minimal implementation that works reliably
3. **Moved HTML to root** - index.html is now in the correct location
4. **Tested API locally** - Confirmed it generates 9,683 bytes successfully
