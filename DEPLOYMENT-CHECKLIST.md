# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Verification

### Required Files Present:
- [x] `api/generate-report.js` - Main API function
- [x] `public/index-enhanced.html` - Enhanced frontend
- [x] `package.json` - Dependencies configuration
- [x] `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment settings
- [x] `index.html` - Root redirect file

### File Verification:
- [x] API function has dynamic content generation
- [x] Frontend calls correct API endpoint (`/api/generate-report`)
- [x] Package.json includes `docx` dependency
- [x] Vercel.json has proper routing configuration

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### 1. GitHub Setup
```bash
# Create new repository on GitHub
# Upload all files from vercel-deployment folder
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel auto-detects configuration
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Post-Deployment Testing
- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL
- [ ] Test form submission with sample data
- [ ] Verify DOCX file downloads correctly
- [ ] Test different project types (Java, AI, Web, etc.)
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Enhanced UI loads at root URL
- Form accepts all required fields
- Progress bar shows during generation
- Dynamic content based on project type
- Professional DOCX download
- Mobile responsive design

### ❌ Common Issues to Check:
- 404 errors (should not occur with current config)
- API timeout (60s limit configured)
- Missing dependencies (only docx required)
- CORS issues (headers configured)

## 📊 Test Cases

### Test Different Project Types:
1. **Java Database Project**
   - Title: "Student Management System using Java and MySQL"
   - Expected: Database-specific chapters

2. **AI/ML Project**
   - Title: "Machine Learning Fraud Detection System"
   - Expected: Data analysis and model training chapters

3. **Web Development Project**
   - Title: "E-commerce Website with React"
   - Expected: Frontend/backend specific chapters

4. **Generic Project**
   - Title: "Recipe Management Application"
   - Expected: Generic but contextual chapters

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check all files are uploaded correctly
2. Verify package.json syntax
3. Ensure vercel.json is valid JSON
4. Check Vercel build logs for errors

### If API Doesn't Work:
1. Verify API file is in `/api` folder
2. Check function export format
3. Ensure dependencies are installed
4. Review Vercel function logs
